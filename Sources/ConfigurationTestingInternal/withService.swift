package import ServiceLifecycle

/// Manages the lifecycle of a service during test execution.
///
/// This function creates a service, runs it in the background, executes test work
/// with the service, and ensures proper cleanup by cancelling the service when done.
/// This pattern is essential for testing services that need to be running during
/// the test but should be properly torn down afterward.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Use this function to test services that need to be actively running:
///
/// ```swift
/// try await withService(createService: {
///     MyTestService()
/// }) { service in
///     // Perform tests with the running service
///     let result = try await service.performOperation()
///     return result
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - createService: A closure that creates and returns the service instance.
///   - work: The test work to perform with the running service.
/// - Returns: The result produced by the work closure.
/// - Throws: Rethrows errors from service creation, service execution, or test work.
